        <h3 class="about_title"> About me </h3>
        <p class="about_paragraph">Kara spreads her passion in many different fields, she is always on the hunt for interdisciplinary perspectives and creative new ideas. Her current focus in her study at TU Berlin in the master’s program: “Theorie und Geschichte der Wissenschaft und Technik” is on transdisciplinary aspects of physics and questions on aesthetics in the natural sciences. While working for a while in the film business in the production department and as directing assistant, she created her own short film and produced a music video. She has an education as an author for film and television from the Master School Berlin and is currently trying to sell her own written screenplays to the film industry. Other than that, through her study in physics she got passionate about data analytics & data science and has worked part time in this field in different positions in Berlin companies. Her personal approach in life to find layovers and patterns everywhere, helps her to see and approach ideas in novel ways.

         <br><br> Kara is trans* feminine and queer and is additionally voluntary working in leading a self-help group for LGBTQI*+ based on Psychodrama methodic. She brings this approach to any company she works for, she wants to help to create safer spaces for queers and to develop a healthy diverse working environment.
